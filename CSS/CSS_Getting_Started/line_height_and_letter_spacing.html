    <h2>Publication History</h2>

    <h3>Premiere</h3>
    <p>
        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman 
        and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When
         Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built 
         his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him
        superhuman strength, flight, energy projection, and other abilities. 
        The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt 
        to create a likeable pro-war character.

    <h3>Solo series</h3>
    <p>
        Since his creation, Iron Man has been 
        used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in
        the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved
        controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead,
        the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological 
        advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.

    <h2>Fictional Character biography</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008), the first film of the
        Marvel Cinematic Universe, and continued to portray the character until his final
        live-action appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Downey's portrayal
        popularized the character, elevating Iron Man into one of Marvel's most 
        recognizable superheroes. Other adaptations of the character appear in 
        animated direct-to-video films, television series, and video games.
